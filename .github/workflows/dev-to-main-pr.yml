          ## Automated Release PR

          This PR was automatically created when changes were pushed to the `dev` branch.

          ### Before merging:
          - [ ] All CI checks pass
          - [ ] Changes have been reviewed and tested on `dev`
          - [ ] Commit messages follow conventional commits format

          ### After merging:
          Semantic Release will automatically:
          - Analyze commits since last release
          - Determine version bump (patch/minor/major)
          - Create GitHub release with changelog
          EOF
